        "Note that the reported runtime is not accurate, and actually caching all of the perturbations of the dummy 56 group library takes\naround 30 minutes (depending on the number of available cores, since this caching is multi-threaded by default). As mentioned in the\nAPI documentation, this can take up to ~5 hours for the 252 group library, and will consume a significant amount of disk space. Now\nto cache one of the SCALE libraries for production use, just change ``multigroup_library`` to be a path to one of SCALE's default\nlibraries (e.g. ``Path(\"~/codes/SCALE-6.3.1/data/scale.rev05.xn252v7.1\")``), and change the ``perturbation_factors`` to the path to\nthe perturbation factors for the library you are using (e.g. ``Path(\"~/codes/SCALE-6.3.1/data/perturb/252n.v7.1\")``) and run the\nthe lines of code above.\n"
